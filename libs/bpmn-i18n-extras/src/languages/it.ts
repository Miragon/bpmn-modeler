/*
 * Modeler-internal translation overlay — the strings the running modeler passes
 * to translate() that the shared @miragon/bpmn-modeler-i18n library does not
 * cover. Merged onto the shared dictionaries at startup via i18n.extend().
 * GENERATED from a runtime harvest — do not edit by hand; see tools/README.md.
 * The overlayScope test fails if the shared library ever ships one of these
 * keys; overlayNeeded fails if a key here is never requested at runtime.
